    "Assessment Task\n",
    "This is a pair-based project (Max 2 students) using the PYTHON programming language. Develop and deploy machine learning models in any one of the following areas only and analyse the results.\n",
    "– Covid-19 – Transport – Crime\n",
    "You can find any public dataset from an authentic resource repository and the dataset should have at least 2000 rows and 8 columns after cleaning and there is not any upper bound.\n",
    "The type of question(s) that you should formulate for the project will depend on the chosen area of the dataset that your pair is considering for the machine learning project.\n",
    "Suggested possible analysis / project questions are mentioned below (this is a small, suggested, sample of questions, other questions may be more appropriate to your project)\n",
    "o What are the most important features for predicting X as a target variable?\n",
    "o Which classification approach do you prefer for the prediction of X as a target variable, and why? o How to classify the loyal and churn customers using Support Vector Machines?\n",
    "o Why is dimensionality reduction important in machine learning?\n",
    "The pair would need to consider the following instructions (a - d) during the development of this pair project.\n",
    "a) Logical justification based on the reasoning for the specific choice of machine learning approaches.\n",
    "b) Multiple machine learning approaches (at least two) using hyperparameters and a comparison\n",
    "between the chosen modelling approaches.\n",
    " c) Visualise your comparison of ML modelling outcomes. You may use a statistical approach to argue that one feature is more important than other features (for example, using PCA).\n",
    "d) Cross-validation methods should be used to justify the authenticity of your ML results.\n",
    "Your pair will present their findings and defend the results in the report (MS Doc or Open word format) by highlighting their individual contribution. Your report should capture the following aspects that are relevant\n",

    "your project investigations.\n",
    "Motivation, a description of the problem domain, and an explanation of how the project's goals are justified using Prediction / Classification / Clustering Rules / Dimensionality Reduction etc..\n",
    "(10 marks) Characterization of data, explanation and description of techniques used for the variation in the\n",
    "accuracy across three training splits (10% / 20%/ 30%) using cross validation techniques.\n",
    "(30 marks) Interpret and explain the results obtained, discuss overfitting / underfitting / generalisation, provide a rationale for the chosen model and use visualisations to support your findings. Comments in Python code, conclusions of the project should be specified at the end of the report. Harvard Style must be\n",
    "used for citations and references.\n",
    "(20 marks) Each team member presents a PowerPoint presentation of their work (maximum 5 slides) to emphasize their distinctive contributions based on their involvement in the project's conceptual\n",
    "understanding, code development, and deployment.\n",
    "(20 marks individual) Each team member fully described their individual contributions to the project in a reflective journal, using at least 500 to 700 words as well as images, diagrams, figures, and visualizations to elaborate\n",
    "his/ her work.\n",
    "Submission Requirements\n",
    "All assessment submissions must meet the minimum requirements listed below. Failure to do so may have implications for the marks awarded.\n",
    "● The code and datasets should be provided and uploaded in zip format on Moodle.\n",
    "● Clearly detail the number of words used in the report.\n",
    "● Number of Words in the report (2000 words +/-10%) excluding diagrams, code, references and\n",
    "titles. Number of words used to express individual contributions is part of the mentioned words.\n",
    "● In the case of individual submission, students will submit a (1000 words +/-10%) report.\n",
    "● Describe the contribution of each team member in the project clearly and use a bar chart or pie\n",
    "chart to represent the effort and time spent during this project. Use version control like Github or any other tool to show the progress of both team members in CA1. You should have at least 5 commits on Github before submission.\n",
    "● The rubric is provided for the detailed breakdown of marks at the end of this CA1.\n",
    "● Use Harvard Referencing when citing third party material\n",
    "● Be the student’s own work.\n",
    "● Include the CCT assessment cover page.\n",
    "● Be submitted by the deadline date specified or be subject to late submission penalties\n",
    "(20 marks individual)\n",
    " \n",
    "● Note: The names of pair members must be uploaded on the link provided on Moodle until 15th October 2023 (23:59).\n",
    "● Must be clearly specified the number of words used after each section in the report."
